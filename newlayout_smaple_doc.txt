You are helping me improve and refine a mortgage assistant chatbot application. 
Please make the following changes:

### TEXT REPLACEMENTS:
1. Replace "AGENT G1" with "PMF AI Mortgage Assistant"
2. Change "Powered by PMF" to "Powered by G1 GROUP"
3. Remove the text "Your AI-powered mortgage assistant"

### CARDS/BUTTONS - MODIFY TO SHOW ONLY 3 CARDS:
Replace the current 4 cards with exactly 3 cards:
1. "Help me find the right Loan"
2. "I have a scenario I need help with"
3. "Build a Live Rate Quote"

Keep the same card styling and icon system.

### LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS:
1. The text input area should start as a CENTERED BOX in the initial view
2. After the user sends the first chat message, the input area should DROP DOWN to the bottom of the screen
3. Ensure smooth transition between these two states

### MOBILE & IFRAME OPTIMIZATION:
1. Make the application fully responsive for mobile devices
2. Optimize the layout to render perfectly within an iframe
3. Ensure proper spacing and padding for mobile viewport (320px and up)
4. Remove any elements that might break iframe functionality
5. Test and ensure the app works seamlessly on all screen sizes

### DISCLAIMER:
Add a small disclaimer text below the input area (or at the bottom) that reads:
"⚠️ AI can make mistakes, please check with your MLO for accuracy"
Style it with small, subtle text (gray color, smaller font size)

### ICON REPLACEMENT:
Replace the blue HOME icon with a more modern, cool mortgage-related icon that:
- Is contemporary and visually appealing
- Still clearly relates to mortgages/home financing
- Maintains the same size and position
- Complements the overall design aesthetic
- Consider icons like: a modern house silhouette, a key with a house outline, a percentage symbol in a home shape, or a modern mortgage/loan related icon

### GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Ensure all text is properly centered and aligned
2. Maintain consistent spacing throughout
3. Optimize performance for iframe embedding
4. Ensure no console errors
5. Test thoroughly on mobile devices (especially small screens like iPhone SE)

### PRIORITY:
The mobile responsiveness and iframe compatibility are critical - please make sure this works perfectly when embedded in an iframe and on mobile devices.
